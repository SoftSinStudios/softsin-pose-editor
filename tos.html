    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: October 12, 2025</p>

    <div class="legal">
      <p>
        These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of software, sites, and services provided by SoftSin Studios, including the SoftSin Pose Editor. By using our software or sites you agree to these terms.
      </p>

      <div class="sep"></div>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        SoftSin Studios creates digital tools for artists. The SoftSin Pose Editor is distributed as freeware. Some optional features or digital items may be offered as paid add-ons or donations processed by third-party providers. All items are delivered digitally.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be legally capable of entering into a contract in your place of residence. If you use our software on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to accept these terms on its behalf.
      </p>

      <h2>3. License to use the software</h2>
      <p>
        We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the software for your own lawful purposes in compliance with these terms and any license notice that appears in the software or documentation. We reserve all rights not expressly granted.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not attempt to disrupt, reverse engineer, or circumvent protections in the software or services except where permitted by applicable law.</li>
        <li>Do not use the services to violate any law, infringe intellectual property, or harm others.</li>
        <li>Do not automate high-volume requests that degrade service stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Accounts and purchases</h2>
      <p>
        Donations and any optional paid features may be processed by third-party payment providers. Those transactions are subject to the provider’s terms and privacy practices. Prices and availability may change. All digital items are delivered electronically upon completion of payment.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The software, documentation, site content, and branding are owned by SoftSin Studios or our licensors and are protected by law. This does not limit your rights in content that you create using the tools. You retain any rights you have in your own outputs and assets, subject to third-party rights in any material you choose to import or reference.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        If you send suggestions or feedback, you grant SoftSin Studios a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use those suggestions to improve our products and services without obligation to you.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Third-party content and links</h2>
      <p>
        Our software may interact with third-party services or link to third-party sites. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party materials, terms, or policies.
      </p>

      <h2>9. No warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The software and services are provided as is and as available. To the maximum extent allowed by law, SoftSin Studios disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. We do not guarantee that the software will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent allowed by law, SoftSin Studios will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, data, or business opportunities. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will not exceed the amount you paid to us for the specific item or feature in the twelve months before the claim, or one hundred US dollars if no payments were made.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SoftSin Studios and its contributors from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from your use of the software or services or your violation of these terms or applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to the services and terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update the software or these terms to improve functionality, security, or compliance. If changes are material we will post an updated date at the top of this page. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated terms.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using the software at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these terms or if required by law. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflict of laws rules. Where permitted, disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Texas, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction there.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Questions or notices can be sent to <a href="mailto:softsinstudios@gmail.com">support@softsinstudios.com</a>.
